Check if the file is documentation (.md) → Use /docs\n2. Check if the file is a test → Use /tests\n3. Check if the file is temporary → Use /storage/temp\n4. If creating in root, verify it's an allowed file type\n\n## REMINDER:\nThis is a PREVENTIVE check. If you're about to create a file in the wrong location, STOP and use the correct directory instead."
